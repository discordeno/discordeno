# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does Discordeno Support TypeScript?

TypeScript is supported to the highest standard by Discordeno. TypeScript is included in Discordeno since Deno supports it. This implies that before using TypeScript, you do not need to compile it. But this isn't the main reason Discordeno is the ideal library for TypeScript programmers. I was experimenting with a lot of various things when I created this library, and automatic typings was one of them.

When I utilised other libraries, I frequently observed incorrect or troublesome typings. This is so that TypeScript won't alert the library developers because most of the Discord API typings aren't utilised by the libraries themselves.

It is quite unlikely that these typings would become wrong or outdated as a result of minor errors like forgetting to update typings because Discordeno utilises them as part of the rest process. Libraries occasionally add a property without also adding it to their typings. Because of this, TypeScript developers cannot use it, only JavaScript developers can. Typings are crucial for TypeScript developers. Typings are treated as a component of the code by Discordeno!  A breaking change in typings is a breaking change for the library!

## How Stable Is Discordeno?

Stability is one of the main problems with practically every library (I have used). None of the libraries showed TypeScript developers the love and care that they deserve. Because breaking changes to typings occasionally occurred without producing a MAJOR bump, TypeScript projects would occasionally fail. As a result, production TypeScript bots would fail. At times, I was the only one keeping the typings up to date for that library. Some libraries that were older than 1.0 didn't even have a stable branch or version, so I didn't have to worry about them undergoing breaking changes.

The finest stability for TypeScript developers is one of my basic goals for this library.
No matter how little, a change that impacts the public API qualifies as a breaking change. I don't care whether we reach version 500. As a library maintainer, you should never be scared to bump a MAJOR because it just involves a tiny modification or a type change because doing so will ruin the end user's experience.

## Why Doesn't Discordeno Use Classes or EventEmitter?

This is a design decision for the library itself. You can still use class on your bot if you want. In fact, I hope someone
makes a framework/templates for this lib one day using classes so that devs have a choice on which style they prefer.
Without trying to write an entire thesis statement on the reasons why I avoided Classes in this library, I will just link to
the best resources that I believe help explain it.

In regards to EventEmitter, I believe a functional event API was a much better choice. EventEmitter at its core, is simply a set ofÂ functions that run when a certain event is emitted. In Discordeno, that function is executed instead of emitting some event to trigger it.

```typescript
// EventEmitter Example
EventEmitter.emit("guildCreate", guild);
// Discordeno Example
bot.events.guildCreate?.(bot, guild);
```

There isn't really any difference especially for users when they use it. One bad thing about EventEmitter is that if
misused it can easily cause memory leaks. It is very easy to open yourself up to these memory leak issues. It has
happened to me when I started coding as well. This is why I wanted Discordeno's implementation to help devs avoid the
issues I had. It prevents anyone from having this as a potential issue. Another issue with EventEmitter is trying to
update the code in those functions without having to deal with headaches left and right of removing and adding
listeners. You don't need to worry about binding or not binding events. They are just pure functions

In Discordeno, this is extremely simple; you just simply give it the new event handlers. For example:

```typescript
bot.events.guildCreate = newGuildCreateEventHandler;
```

## Why Do You Have A Class for Collection If Classes Are Bad?

The Collection class is an exception in the library where a class was allowed. This is because Collection extends Map.
The Map class is provided by JavaScript itself and is extremely fast. You can perform millions of operations a second
with a Map. Maps are too useful to avoid and don't have downsides like EventEmitters do. The Collection class simply
adds on other functionality that Discordeno users felt they needed. Although I am against using classes whenever
possible, I am also a big supporter of providing the best developer experience.

## Why Are there no options in Discordeno?

Discordeno is not a library that handles code in the exact way every person wants it to. It is opinionated. Discordeno
defaults to the Discord recommended options or the best options for majority of developers needs. For example, there is
no option of fetching all members startup. This is a practice that Discord does not recommend or want users doing. By
default, we don't support stuff like this. In Discordeno, we follow Discords recommended solution and it just works
internally. The End! No fuss! No Muss! Just good stuff!

Now, I understand that there are times when it's necessary to be able to customize this and fetch them all. If you are
advanced enough to need these options, you should be able to simply do it yourself. For most users, this is just an
unnecessary option. The main module should remain minimalistic and easy to use for 99% of users.

## Why Do I See errors Like "MISSING_VIEW_CHANNEL" or "BOTS_HIGHEST_ROLE_TOO_LOW"?

Discordeno is the only library(that I have used), that has built in permission handling. A lot of bots get automatically
banned by Discord because they forget to handle permissions. When bots don't check permissions and continue to send
requests to the API, this leads to bots being banned. I have tried to request adding this feature into libraries but
they were reluctant to do so because it would require the devs to maintain the library whenever an update was made by
Discord.

Discordeno provides you specific keywords that you can use to send a clean response to the end user of your choosing. I
have even seen some bots have hundreds of thousands of Missing Permission or Missing Access errors because libraries
don't handle it. IMO, this is a crucial part of any good library as much as it is to handle rate limiting.

```typescript
import { Bot, Errors, Message } from "https://deno.land/x/discordeno@16.0.0/mod.ts";

export function handleCommandError(bot: Bot, message: Message, type: Errors) {
  switch (type) {
    case Errors.MISSING_MANAGE_NICKNAMES:
      return bot.helpers.sendMessage(message.channelId, {
        content:
          "The bot does not have the necessary permission to manage/edit other user's nicknames. Grant the **MANAGE_NICKNAME** permission to the bot and try again.",
      });
    case Errors.MISSING_MANAGE_ROLES:
      // Note: i18n is not part of the library. This is just an example of how you could use i18n for custom error responses.
      return bot.helpers.sendMessage(message.channelId, { content: i18n.translate(type) });
  }
}
```
