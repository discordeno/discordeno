# cache-proxy-plugin

For your bot, this plugin adds functionality for caching. It offers two
different cache types.

1. In Memory Cache (Crazy fast but lost whenever your bot restarts.)

2. Persistent Cache (Slower than memory, but still crazy fast. Unless you
   restart your cache, nothing is lost.)
