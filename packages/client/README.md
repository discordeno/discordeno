# @discordeno/client

This package is intended to provide a class based implementation on top of discordeno. It is based on Eris libraries API as it is just amazing! This also means since the API is near 1:1 the migration for Eris -> Discordeno is as simple as:

```ts
npm uninstall eris && npm install @discordeno/client
```

Then replace all `from 'eris';` with `from '@discordeno/client'` and enjoy!
