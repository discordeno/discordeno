# Decisions To Make Before Continuing

This guide is going to skip the basics as it expects you to have the ability to make these key decisions.

## Choose A Runtime

Discordeno supports several platforms including Node.JS, Bun, and Deno. This means you get to make the fun decision of choosing which runtime to go with. As my personal recommendation at the time of writing this guide I would highly recommend you chose Node.JS

This guide will proceed with Node.JS but you should apply the same concepts in your own runtime. Should you need help with another runtime, please contact us on Discord.

## Choose A Coding Style

Discordeno provides you the option to use a Class based approach or a No-Class based approach. If you are willing to take your time and optimize your bot to the max, I highly recommend you go the No-Class route. However, this guide will use the Class based approach as I believe most users will end up choosing this route. Should you require any help with the functional approach please contact us on Discord.
