# Getting started with Discordeno

<!-- TODO: Do we want to keep this? Or rewrite a bit this -->

:::note
Discordeno is not intended for beginners, however you can still utilize it
:::

## Installation

You can install the npm package `@discordeno/bot` and this package will take care of setting up the REST & Gateway for your bot.

```bash
npm install @discordeno/bot # Using npm
yarn add @discordeno/bot    # Using yarn
pnpm add @discordeno/bot    # Using pnpm
bun add @discordeno/bot     # Using bun (as a package manager)
```

If you are using Deno you will need to still use the npm package, so you will need to use the `npm:` prefix in your imports.
