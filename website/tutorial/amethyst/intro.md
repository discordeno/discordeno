# Amethyst

Amethyst is a [Discordeno](https://github.com/discordeno/discordeno) plugin that is incredibly robust and flexible. It
promotes standard practices and is geared at bigger bots.

This framework is not for you if you cannot utilise Maps and Sets without reading them up. We presume you have a solid
foundation in typescript/javascript and dicord bots.

[Documentation](https://deno.land/x/amethyst)

## Features

- Thanks to Amethyst's adaptability, you can change a lot of things and add features as you see appropriate.
- A developer may create slash or message interactions with Amethyst.
- Assistance with interactions, such as selection, built-in buttons, and more.
- Custom discord.js like event system without the event emitter.
- Explore more incredible features of our framework.

## Why Amethyst?

Amethyst makes use of the [Discordeno](https://github.com/discordeno/discordeno) plugin system to streamline your coding
process and help you get going more quickly. Support for message and slash commands that doesn't need altering any code.

- Fully programmable

- Easy to learn and utilise.

- Conversion from Discord.js bots is simple.

## Ideas

The objective is to provide a framework that can be used with both Node.js and Deno while minimising transitions and
rewrites.

- Easy to understand and use.
- Cover up complexity in the engine keeping the end user interface as simple as possible.

## Future Updates

Creation of discord setup wizards for commands like welcome, context menus and paginated messages.
