# Nodejs Bot Template

This template is a minimal template that uses [discordeno.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discordeno.js), a wrapper
around discordeno, which brings up a djs-like interface but also includes the core Features (Cross Ratelimit, Zero
Downtime Restart, Resharding...)

## Setup

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill your bot token there.

## Run Bot

- node index.js
