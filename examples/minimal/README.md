# Minimal Bot Template

Just the minimum to get a working bot using interactions.

This does not include any kind of caching or other feature you might need.
It includes a /ping command to show the bot latency

## Setup

- Download the source
- Install the dependencies using `yarn`
- Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env
- Fill out the .env file

## Run Bot

- run `yarn` to install the dependencies
- run `yarn build` to build the source
- run `yarn start` to run the bot
