# Discordeno Bot Templates

In this directory you will find some example bots written using Discordeno.

## Minimal & Beginner

A very minimal bot with only a /ping command to show how to set-up a discordeno bot for interactions

The beginner template is a bit more complete and has a caching system already setup

## Advanced

A bit more complex bot compared to minimal or beginner but still very small bot to show how to use discordeno to create bots

## BigBot

The BigBot template is intended for more complex systems that need scaling.
