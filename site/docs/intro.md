# Discordeno

> Discord API library for [Deno](https://deno.land)

- [Documentation](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/discordeno/mod.ts)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/ddeno)

## Features

- **Secure & stable**: Discordeno is secure and stable. One of the greatest
  issues with almost every library is stability; types are outdated, less (or
  minimal) parity with the API, core maintainers have quit or no longer actively
  maintain the library, and whatnot. Discordeno, on the other hand, is actively
  maintained to ensure great performance and convenience. Moreover, it
  internally checks all missing permissions before forwarding a request to the
  Discord API so that the client does not get globally-banned by Discord.
- **Simple, Efficient, & Lightweight**: Discordeno is simplistic, easy-to-use,
  versatile while being efficient and lightweight.
- [**Functional API**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):
  Functional API ensures an overall concise yet performant code while removing
  the difficulties of extending built-in classes and inheritance.
