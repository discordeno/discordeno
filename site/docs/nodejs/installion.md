# Installing Node.js and Discordeno

To use the Discordeno library you would need to install Node.js and then Discordeno from NPM.

Go on this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest version of Node.js. Then open the downloaded file
and follow the instructions of the installer to install Node.js.

## Create a Folder

Open your File Explorer and create a new folder (Ex: `discordbot`) in your desired directory. After this open your Coding
IDE and create a new file (Ex: `index.js`) in the folder you created.

### Initalize NPM & Install Discordeno

In order to keep track of the dependencies, you need to initialize NPM, which creates a `package.json` file.

```cli
npm init --yes 
```

Then you need to install Discordeno. Go to your terminal and run the following command:

```cli
npm install discordeno
```
