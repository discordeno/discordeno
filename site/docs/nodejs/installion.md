# Installing Node.js and Discordeno
To use the Discordeno library you would need to install Node.js and then Discordeno from NPM.

Go on this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest version of Node.js.
Then open the downloaded file and follow the instructions of the installer to install Node.js.

## Create a Folder
Open your File Explorer and create a new folder (Ex: `discordbot`) in your wished directory.
After this open your Coding IDE and create a new file (Ex: `index.js`) in the folder you created.

### Initalize NPM
Inorder to keep track of the dependencies, you need to initialize NPM, which creates a `package.json` file.
```cli
npm init
```
Running this command will request you some information on your terminal, which you can fill in or skip with `enter`.

### Install Discordeno
You are finally ready to install Discordeno. Go to your terminal and run the following command:
```cli
npm install discordeno
```
