# Installing Node.js and Discordeno

To use the Discordeno library you first need to install Node.js and then Discordeno from NPM.

Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest version of Node.js. Open the downloaded file and
follow the instructions of the installer to install Node.js.

## Create a Folder

Open your file manager and create a new folder (e.g.: `discordbot`) in your desired directory. Then open the code editor
of your choice and create a new file (e.g.: `index.js`) in the folder you just have created.

### Initalize NPM & Install Discordeno

In order to keep track of the dependencies, you need to initialize NPM, which generates a `package.json` file.

```cli
$ npm init --yes
```

Then you need to install Discordeno. Go to your terminal and run the following command:

```cli
$ npm install discordeno
```
