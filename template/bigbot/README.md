# Discordeno Big Bot Template

Support: https://discord.gg/ddeno

This template is designed for bots that aim or are already in millions of
Discord servers.

## Setup

- Use the template generator button to make your own copy.
- Delete all the template folders except the bigbot folder.
- Move all files from the bigbot folder to the root of the project.
  - You may encounter an issue with .vscode but force move the files to the root
    of the project. We have setup special import maps in this template that
    should override the general .vscode folder already in the root folder.
- Rename the .env.example file to .env
- Fill out the .env file
- Go to configs.ts file and remove all the intents you don't want in your bot.
- Install `make` if you want to make it easier to use.
  - This may be switched to `deno tasks` when it is available.

## Usage

- Always run the `rest` process first. `make rest`
- Start the `bot` process next. `make bot`
- Lastly, start the `gateway` process. `make gateway`

Note: The `gateway` process and `rest` are designed not to be shut off. So once
those are on, the only thing you should be doing is restarting your `bot`
process.

## Details

### Translating Application Commands

The template supports translations for application commands. This is possible
using guild commands. If you use global commands, translations will not work and
will default to english.

If you prefer a different default(not english), please use the Find And Replace
to change the `'english'` everywhere necessary.

#### Autocomplete & Type Checking

One cool thing about the translations is that you will get autocomplete and type
checking built in for all the keys. This will ensure you do not miss a key to be
translated. It will also make it easier to code by providing the autocomplete
functionality.

### Updating Application Commands

The template is designed in a way that you will no longer need to worry about
updating or maintaing your commands.

- Global Commands: For simplicity you can add a line in mod.ts to update them
  globally. This generally takes 1 call and isn't a deal breaker.
  - `/update global` is also available on your development server, to trigger
    manually.
- Guild Commands: This is a bit more complicated. By default, our system will
  update guild commands on demand! Instead of making a million requests for all your servers, we will update them as needed.

**Guild Commands Kwik & Command Versioning**

For Global Commands you can make 1 request to api to update all commands on
restart. Its not a big deal. But with Guild commands essentially you need to
make a request per guild. This can get spammy. That would be crazy. To solve
this we created the concept of `commandVersions`. This basically will decide
whether or not guild commands should be updated.

Kwik is a file based database I used in order to make this setup easy and allow any dev using this template to use a database of their choice for their bot. I do not recommend using Kwik as your database. Please add a full database of
your choice for your bot. You can even replace Kwik should you choose in the
database folder.

Process:

1. You update your command options/args or create new commands etc...
2. Increment the `CURRENT_SLASH_COMMAND_VERSION` in `src/database/commandVersion.ts`

- I recommend moving this into your database so you can build a dev command or eval and update this on the fly as you wish.

3. Now whenever a guild emits any event, this will make sure to update the guild commands if necessary. If it already has the latest commands, it will just ignore. If it was never updated or is using an outdated version, it will update it.

Aside from the automated system, there is also the option of `/update guild id` to update a guild manually.
